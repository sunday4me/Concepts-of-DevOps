DevOps assumes a culture where collaboration among the development, operations, and business teams is considered a critical aspect of the journey

Important benefits of DevOps are:

1. Predictability: DevOps offers a significantly lower failure rate for new releases.
2. Maintainability: It enables effortless recovery in the event of a new release crashing or disabling the application.
3. Reproducibility: Versioning the builds or the code enables earlier versions to be restored as needed.
4. Higher quality: Incorporating infrastructure issues improves application development quality.
5. Time to market: Streamlined software delivery reduces time to market by 50%.
6. Reduced risk: Incorporating security into the software lifecycle reduces defects across its lifecycle.
7. Cost-efficiency: Driving cost-efficiency in software development pleases senior management.
8. Resiliency: The software system is more stable, secure, and changes are auditable.
9. Breaks larger codebase into manageable pieces: DevOps is based on the agile programming method, which supports breaking down larger codebases into smaller, more manageable chunks.

## DevOps principles
DevOps adoption has produced several principles that have evolved (and are still evolving). Most solution providers have developed their own variants.
All these principles take a holistic approach to DevOps, and organizations of all sizes can adopt them.

## Develop and test against a production-like environment
The objective is to allow the development and quality assurance (QA) teams to develop and test against systems that behave like production systems, 
so they can see how the application behaves and performs well before it is ready for deployment.
The application should be exposed to production-like systems as early in the lifecycle as possible to address three major potential issues. 
First, this permits the application to be tested in an environment that is close to the actual environment. Second, it allows application-delivery 
processes to be tested and validated upfront. Third, it enables the operations team to verify early in the lifecycle how their environment will behave 
when applications are deployed, thereby allowing them to create a finely tweaked, application-aware environment.

## Deploying with repeatable, reliable processes
This principle allows the development and operations teams to support an agile software development process throughout the lifecycle. Automation is 
critical to creating processes that are iterative, reliable, and repeatable. Hence, the organization must create a delivery pipeline that enables continuous, 
automated deployment and testing. Frequent deployments also allow teams to test the deployment processes, thereby lowering the risk of deployment failures during actual releases.

## Monitor and validate operational quality
Organizations are good at monitoring applications in production because they have tools that capture metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) in real time. 
This principle moves monitoring to early in the lifecycle, ensuring that automated testing monitors functional and nonfunctional attributes of the application 
early in the process. Whenever an application is tested and deployed, quality metrics should be captured and analyzed. Monitoring tools provide early warning 
about operational and quality issues in the landscape that may occur in production. These metrics should be gathered in a format that all business stakeholders 
can understand and articulate.

## Amplify feedback loops
One objective of DevOps processes is to enable organizations to react and make changes more rapidly. In software delivery, this goal requires an organization to 
get early feedback and then learn rapidly from every action it takes. This principle calls for organizations to create communication channels that allow stakeholders 
to access and act on feedback. Development may act by adjusting its project plans or priorities. Production may act by enhancing production environments.
